Tasks:

0. Write a function called "reset_to_98" that takes a pointer to an integer as a parameter and updates the value it points to with 98.

1. Write a function called "swap_int" that swaps the values of two integers.

2. Write a function called "_strlen" that returns the length of a string.

3. Write a function called "_puts" that prints a string followed by a new line.

4. Write a function called "print_rev" that prints a string in reverse followed by a new line.

5. Write a function called "rev_string" that reverses a string.

6. Write a function called "puts2" that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

7. Write a function called "puts_half" that prints half of a string followed by a new line. If the number of characters is odd, it should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2.

8. Write a function called "print_array" that prints n elements of an array of integers followed by a new line. The numbers should be separated by a comma and a space.

9. Write a function called "_strcpy" that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest. It should return a pointer to dest.

10. Write a function called "_atoi" that converts a string to an integer. The number in the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters, and the function should take into account all the - and + signs before the number. If there are no numbers in the string, it should return 0.

11. Create a program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme. You are allowed to use the standard library, and you can refer to the man pages for srand, rand, time. Additionally, gdb and objdump can help.
